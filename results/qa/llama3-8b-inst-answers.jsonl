However, hydroelectric power is still a viable option for Singapore, albeit with some limitations.\n\nHere are some reasons why hydroelectric power might be feasible in Singapore:\n\n1. **Tidal power**: Singapore is located near the equator, where tidal ranges are relatively small. However, this also means that the tidal power potential is relatively low.\n2. **Run-of-river systems**: These systems involve diverting a portion of a river's flow to generate electricity. While this approach can be effective, it may not be suitable for Singapore's small rivers and streams.\n3. **Pumped storage hydroelectricity**: This approach involves building a reservoir at a higher elevation than the power plant. During periods of low electricity demand, water is pumped from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir. When electricity demand is high, water is released from the upper reservoir through the power plant, generating electricity.\n4. **Hydroelectric power from existing water infrastructure**: Singapore has a well-developed water infrastructure, including reservoirs, dams, and water treatment plants. By harnessing the energy potential of these existing water infrastructure, Singapore can generate additional electricity without incurring significant additional costs.\n\nIn conclusion, while the potential for generating electricity using hydroelectric power in Singapore is limited, it is still a viable option for the country.
