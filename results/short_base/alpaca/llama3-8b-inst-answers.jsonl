You can also use a rose-specific fertilizer for better results.\n\n4. **Pruning**: Prune your rose plant in late winter or early spring, before new growth begins. Remove any dead, diseased, or damaged branches, and cut back canes to about 12-18 inches from the ground.\n\n5. **Pest management**: Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites. Use neem oil or insecticidal soap to control infestations.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to keep your rose plant healthy and thriving."], "idxs": [275], "new_tokens": [276], "wall_time": [9.217103958129883]}], "tstamp": 1753151981.1547995}
